Hello everyone!  I am trying out jekyll and github pages hosting without having a copy of ruby or jekyll on my local computer.  The only issue I have found thus far into it is the ability to change images is a bit of a pain.  Once I find a plce to store my images for free, this may be a fun little experiment.
