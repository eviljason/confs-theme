I have lost 45 pounds in the last year.   

I thought i would share how I did it.    
First, I brew my own beer. So, I started making ultra low alcohol beer. I also do not partake in as much of the libations as i once did.   

I  changed my diet.  Breakfast is 2 servings of muesli. It gives me my fiber and some energy items like nuts, seeds and berries.   

Lunch is a lean protein like a chicken breast with a really large salad. I try to keep my carbs low but I also have to feel full.   

Dinner was harder to figure out. I didn't want to inconvenience my family. I decide that my only rule for dinner was that I didn't want fried food. I just adjust my portions and I drink a very large glass of water before eating.
